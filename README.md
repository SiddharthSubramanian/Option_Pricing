# Option_Pricing
Objective: This software is used for pricing the Option using many ways. The Software also has built-in functionalities to verify the input variables such as validating the risk-neutral probabilities, checking the states of the option to maturity etc.


Description of files structure : The file contains two main folders as below:
Main_project_Code 
BinModel.cpp 
GrowOption.cpp 
LookbackOption.cpp 
ParOption.cpp 
PathInfo.cpp 
PricePathGenerator.cpp 
main.cpp 
Function Descriptions: We will explore the order of the function calls that are made in the code which invokes each of the other functions before the final calculation

The first call is made inside Main. cpp, which invokes BinModel  

The BinModel gets user input for S0, U, D, R, K, N. This function also computes the risk-neutral probability and computes the stock price at each node i

Then the call goes to price Pathgenerator which is the code that does major calculation which involves the calculation of path, probability and price by calling the respective functions

The Pathinfo option is majorly used to return the results such as Pathnumber, Probability, Path, Prices according to respective path numbers
AsianCallPayoffOption.cpp, ParOption.cpp, LookbackOption.cpp and GrowOption.cpp is used for calculating Asian Call, Parisian, Lookback and Consecutive Growth options respectively.
The above-mentioned files call the Pathdependent option for calculating the final price for each of the option 
Results are returned by Option. h 

Following are the list of the functions used in the program
BinModel::GetInputData -  This function is designed to capture the inputs from the user which are required to price the option including Stock Price, Up factor, Down factor, Risk-free rate, the number of time steps(N). The inputs are stored in respective variables declared earlier and necessary validation is performed to make sure that incorrect data is not entered and chances of arbitrage are eliminated.  
BinModel::S - This function calculates the price at each branching node of the binomial tree by the up and down factor 
BinModel::RiskNeutProb: This is fairly a simple function to calculate the risk-neutral probability indicated by q and the compliment is denoted by p.
PricePathsGenerator::GenPathByNumber - This function takes the number x and converts it into binary. It then stores the individual binary digits as consecutive elements in the array Path. If every x from 0 to (2^N)-1 is input into this function, it will return every possible array with different combinations of 0s and 1s of length N.
PricePathsGenerator::GenPricesByPath - This function takes the vector of binary numbers and calculates the prices according to the up and down factor 
PricePathsGenerator::GenProbabilityByPath - This function calculates the probability of propagation along a path of binary numbers for each vector
PathInfo::GetPathNumber(),PathInfo::GetProbability(),PathInfo::GetPath(),PathInfo::GetPrices() - returns the vector of pathnumber, probability , vector of path and vector of prices respectively 
AllPaths gets values from Pathinfo and stacks them to form a single matrix of all the vectors appended (Allpath doesnâ€™t have a .cpp file)
AsianCallPayoffOption::Calculates payoff value for the path generated by given path number in pathInfo. The steps are as below:
Get input values from BinModel
Get vector of Price by path number from PathInfo
Calculate the average of value of the vector from 0 to T
Calculate payoff as the difference between the latest value of Strike Price and the  Average Price
Return payoff
LookbackOption::GetPayoffByPathInfo -  Calculates payoff value for the path generated by given path number in pathInfo. The steps are as below:
Get input values from BinModel
Get vector of Price by path number from PathInfo
Insert the value of S0 at the beginning of the Prices vector
Calculate the minimum value of the vector as min_price
Calculate payoff as the latest value of Price (Prices[N]) -  min_price
Return payoff
ParisianOption:: GetPayoffByPathInfo -  Calculates payoff value for the path generated by given path number in pathInfo. The steps are as below:
Get input values from BinModel
Get vector of Price by pathnumber from PathInfo
Insert the value of S0 at the beginning of the Prices vector
Calculates the moments of price consecutively above the strike price and stores the maximum sequence of such occurrence. This particular result of the maximum of such sequence is the final payoff for that particular path
Return payoff
GrowOption::GetPayoffByPathInfo - Calculates payoff value for the path generated by given path number in pathInfo. The steps are as below:
Get input values from BinModel
Get vector of Price by pathnumber from PathInfo
Insert the value of S0 at the beginning of the Prices vector
Calculates the period of consecutive increase in Prices along a path. The maximum period of such consecutive increments in price is the payoff for that particular path of the Growth option
Return payoff
Payoff obtained from the above options are input for PathDependantOption which then calculates the final discounted price
Final Price is returned by Option.h.
